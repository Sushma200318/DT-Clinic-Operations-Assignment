Clinic inventory audit &amp; patient communication system
# DT Clinic Operations Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my solution to the DT Business Analyst Assignment.
The focus is on reducing doctor workload and bringing structure to daily clinic operations.

## Task 1: Inventory Micro-Audit
A daily 20–25 minute system to detect billing and inventory errors early,
improve staff discipline, and prevent month-end inventory shocks.

## Task 2: Patient Care & Communication System
A Google Sheet–based workflow that automates routine patient communication
and ensures only exceptions reach the doctor.

## Key Design Principles
- Protect doctor time
- Automate routine work
- Use human judgment only where necessary
- Systems should absorb mistakes, not depend on perfection

## Tools Used
- HMS (assumed clinic system)
- Google Sheets & Google Forms
- Optional Google Apps Script (logic only)
